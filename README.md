###  Duong Le
I am currently undergraduate student and I will graduate this May. I'm from a small village in Vietname and I've been here for about 7 years. My interest is on Web development, Mobile Development and, of course, video game (even though I did not take the class yet). I also like to design interface and currently also taking CS422 because of that passion.
      
### Corey Habel
I am originally from Gurnee, a suburb about an hour north of Chicago. This is my third year at UIC and I plan to graduate next May. I have an interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am currently the Mars Rover Electronics & Programming lead for the AIAA chapter at UIC, where we are designing a small rover to be launched in a suborbital rocket which will drive on a path, drop markers, and transmit telemetry and images back to the ground station.
    
### Akhil Thuthika
I am from Northwest suburbs located around Crystal Lake/Algonquin area. This is my last semester at UIC so I plan on graduating at the end of the semester. I am interested in software developement and took some CS courses to explore some of the emerging topics in todays market and Data Science happened to be no exception. With that said, I was also part of an organization called Engineering World Health. I took part as a board member where the goal was to lead the teams to build medical/health realted projects that can be sent to the third world countries.
