###  Liam Edelman
Hailing from Deer Park, Illinois, Liam Edelman is a Computer Science major at UIC. Currently in his senior year, he plans on graduating with a Bachelors of Science in CS this Fall. Liam first began coding in High School, and is proficient in many different languages, such as C/C++/C#, Python, Java, and SQL. This semester, Liam is taking multiple classes in the Artificial Intelligence discipline such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Introduction to Data Science. In his free time Liam enjoys watching movies, participating in online fantasy sports leagues, and playing video games. 

###  Duong Le
I am currently undergraduate student and I will graduate this May. I'm from a small village in Vietname and I've been here for about 7 years. My interest is on Web development, Mobile Development and, of course, video game (even though I did not take the class yet). I also like to design interface and currently also taking CS422 because of that passion.
      
### Corey Habel
I am originally from Gurnee, a suburb about an hour north of Chicago. This is my third year at UIC and I plan to graduate next May. I have an interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am currently the Mars Rover Electronics & Programming lead for the AIAA chapter at UIC, where we are designing a small rover to be launched in a suborbital rocket which will drive on a path, drop markers, and transmit telemetry and images back to the ground station.
    
### Akhil Thuthika
I am from Northwest suburbs located around Crystal Lake/Algonquin area. This is my last semester at UIC so I plan on graduating at the end of the semester. I am interested in software developement and took some CS courses to explore some of the emerging topics in todays market and Data Science happened to be no exception. With that said, I was also part of an organization called Engineering World Health. I took part as a board member where the goal was to lead the teams to build medical/health realted projects that can be sent to the third world countries.

## Reports

### Website Reports:

#### https://www.wunderground.com/history/
The data represents the history of weather in the location that the user wants to look at. The data of weather consists of many attribute such as low temperature, higher temperature, humidity, etc. This database is useful for scientists who want to research on weather and need data to work with. It organized by date or the time of the day depend on the user setting. This data set would join with census database or crime database because the weather would effect with change in population and crime rate.
 
#### https://www.ilsos.gov/isa/landSalesSearch.do
Illinois Public domain land tract Sales list all of the land transaction within illinois. The database contains the name of the purchaser, date, area size, and price. This data is useful for real estate people who looking for purchase lands and need to find who owns them. This data could join with businesses licenses or demographic of chicago because some businesses dealing with land ownership.



#### https://www.chicagohealthatlas.org/

This is a dataset of many different health indicators and statistics for the city of Chicago. It shows data for statistics such as vaccinations, mortality rates, and drug use. These stats are then organized by demographics such as age, race, sex, etc. This data is useful for noticing trends in these demographics, such as how they relate to certain health conditions, or toward habits like tobacco use and violence. This data can be joined to other datasets including demographic information to analyze relationships between other factors such as geographic location and the resulting health issues.

#### http://gis.chicagopolice.org/clearmap_crime_sums/startpage.htm#

This is an interesting tool that overlays many different crime occurrences on a map of Chicago. The data can be filtered by different properties, such as type of crime, location, and time frame. The interactive map can be zoomed and panned around, but also has a table listing in the sidebar for easy retrieval of the raw data. The data given here is useful for analyzing trends in crime around the city, such as identifying the most dangerous neighborhoods or where the most robberies occur. This dataset could be joined with data sets on businesses and demographics when looking for trends in crimes near certain businesses or neighborhoods with specific ethnicities or ages.

#### http://aqicn.org/city/chicago/

AQICN displays the real-time Air Quality Index along with historical data for air quality in many locations. It has several locations in Chicago, which could be useful for analyzing historical pollution data across multiple parts of the city. The data set includes data for temperature, pollution level, ozone quality, and wind speed. This data could be joined with other sets of demographic and geographic information to look for trends in income or ethnicity and air quality levels. For example, it would be reasonable to predict that lower income areas would have worse air quality, which could be analyzed with these data sets.


#### https://www.cookcountyil.gov/service/sweetened-beverage-tax

This data consists of collecting taxes on sweetened beverages. This gives user the details needed to understand which areas and businesses are paying taxes in the city of Chicago. Any distributor of bottled sweetened beverages and any distributor of syrp and/or powder used to produce sweetened beverages.With that being said, we can narrow down the areas that are being taxed and also trace back to which businesses are not paying taxes for the sweetened beverages, which allows the city to penalize them. Doing so allows the city to get what they deserve.


#### http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/data/land-use/inventory

CMAP is supposed to gather the surveys based on the land nearby and collect its’ uses. This is supposed to be an important field to the use of land use and transportation research in the south side of Chicago. The users of this include state, federal, transportation and academic agencies. It's based on the polygon use approach to collect the data. The water and vacant forestland categories are no longer in use because they don't conform to property boundaries. With this being said, it’s good to collect the data like this so we make commutes and such more efficient. 


#### https://cps.edu/SchoolData/Pages/SchoolData.aspx

This dataset lists the Chicago Public Schools demographics and data. The main data that can be scraped is the student data which includes race, number of students currently attending a CPS school, economic status, and some small details of coursework. This data could be particularly useful to data scientists, in that it can give insight into how diverse the student body is and whether more schools are needed for incoming students. This dataset could be joined with the crime data set to show the effect of education on crime, and whether more students are enrolled in school depending on the area they live in.

The Zillow dataset is a collection of prices and locations of apartments for sale throughout the Chicagoland area. The useful information available in the dataset is the apartment type, location, price, and other additional details. From this dataset we can garner a general idea of how expensive living in the city is, in addition to the way chicagoans value different types of apartments. For additional theories, we could combine this with the data from crime reports and business licenses to get an even clearer picture of the kind of area an apartment is located in. 

#### https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=IL

This dataset is a detailed list of power plants around the nation. It lists their location, the type of plant, the amount of power produced, and other information to distinguish what plant they are and their location. This could be a useful set for data science, since it can be used to display where our power comes from and what we are using to create it. If we combine this power plant dataset with a dataset detailing income areas we can probably get an idea of where these plants are generally located, in addition to seeing if there is any relation to the type of plant.
